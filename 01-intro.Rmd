# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Just re-read the abstract, mkay?

## Hypotheses

1.1 (directed) Higher number of extrapolations for the stimuli of the untrained/incomplete category in the blocked training condition, compared to the mixed training condition, in the transfer phase
1.2 (directed) Higher number of extrapolations for the stimuli of the untrained/incomplete category in the rule instructions condition compared to the neutral instructions condition in the transfer phase
1.3 (undirected, exploratory) Interaction of rule order and the rule instructions on the number of extrapolations within the untrained/incomplete category

2.1 (directed) quicker learning of categories with rule instructions than without in the mixed rule condition
2.2 (exploratory, undirected) Interaction of learning accuracy between training blocks (3-12) and rule instructions in the blocked rule condition
