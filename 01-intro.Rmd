## Theoretical Background

One major component of everyday human action and cognition is the ability to form concepts, abstract rules and learn all sorts of categories. From stopping at a red traffic light to being able to talk about objects like apples and oranges (so not to confuse them) or abstract concepts like musical genres - or, in fact, being able to talk to each other in the first place, since language and communication itself follow a whole range of rules and concepts - category learning is simply a fundamental component of the human experience. Yet even after more than a century of research on the topic [@Hull1920], little is still known about the cognitive processes by which new rules and rule abstractions are learned. There are some predominant theories, however. The account of a prototype model assumes that a category has a prototypical example or a central tendency, and that new stimuli are assigned to a category based on similarity to that prototype [see @Posner1968; @Reed1972; @Love2004]. One might infer, for example, a musical act to be a rock band from the fact that some members on stage wear electric guitars. Another account is that of exemplar models, which posit that memory instances of observations made by a learner make up a category [@Kruschke1992; @Nosofsky1986]. Then there is decision bound theory, which employs an abstract psychological space in which a stimulus might be perceived and that is bounded by a decision criterion, e.g. a rule, that is responsible for classifying a stimulus [@Ashby1988; @Reed1972; @Erickson1998]. Hybrid accounts exist.

One foundational contribution to the research on human concept and category learning is the Six Problems paradigm introduced by @Shepard1961. In their seminal work, participants were presented with a set of eight stimuli that can be seperated into two groups along three binary dimensions (shape, size and color) which they had to classify into two groups. There were six types of classifications for the sets of stimuli (hence the name). Figure \@ref(fig:01-shj) shows this in detail. What the researchers found was a distinct order of difficulty in learning these rules (I < II < III, IV, V < VI), mostly independent of the items to learn, be it simple geometric shapes, musical instruments or everyday kitchen tools [@Shepard1961; replicated and extended by @Nosofsky1994; also @Smith2004]. This hierarchical order coincides with the circumstance that for successful classification in the type I problem, one needs to consider only one of the dimensions (e.g. color for type I in fig. \@ref(fig:01-shj)), two dimensions in problem type II (color and shape for type II in fig. \@ref(fig:01-shj)) and all three stimulus dimensions for other types. In the following decades this paradigm became (and still remains to be) a major benchmark for category learning models and spurred ideas about how feature attention may play a major role in the category learning process [@Nosofsky1986]. One leading formal framework resulting from this insight is the Attention Learning COVEring map [ALCOVE; @Kruschke1992], which uses an attention mechanism to focus on a predictive stimulus dimension and to switch that focus to a different dimension when errors are made. By combining this (selective) attention mechanism with the stimulus generalization from memory assumed by xemplar theory, ALCOVE has very successfully been able to mirror human behavior in category learning - not only in the six problem task, but other well established tasks like the 5-4 problem [@Medin1978] or the inverse base-rate effect [@Kruschke1992; @Kruschke2001; @Kruschke2003].

Recent research, however, raises some serious questions on that account. In a widely recognized study, [@Kurtz2013] identified a major influence of rule-related language on a subject's performance in the classic setup of @Shepard1961: the long held learning advantage in solving type II category structures over types III-V disappears when experimental instructions don't use the mentioning of rules. Additionally, there appear to be two groups of participants: some who solve the type II problem better than the type IV problem while solve type II worse than type IV. The researchers also note that, in line with the original work of @Kruschke1992, ALCOVE can predict a similar pattern for type II as observed by [@Kurtz2013] when attention learning is "turned off" (ibid., p.564), it cannot do so while keeping it's accurate predictions for type I and IV at the same time. These results imply entirely different cognitive processes being at work there and importantly, with predicting the type II advantage being a major benchmark for many formal models to pass, they challenge the common conviction of stimulus generalization driven by dimensional selective attention.


`[such as ALCOVE [@Kruschke1992], SUSTAIN [@Love2004] or DIVA [@Kurtz2007], which can all successfully predict the aforementioned difficulty hierarchy.]` 

However, these models all fail at predicting novel or previously unencountered stimuli in one way or another `[proably elaborate?]`, especially when it comes to problem type II, which is otherwise known as "exclusive OR" (XOR) problem. `[Since categories can not be seperated by a flat plane in a three-dimensional space with each dimension relating to the three attributes of the stimuli. --needs better explanation. Or none.]`. Beyond that, 


## Research Questions

`[apparently this needs a lot more detail?]` Building on that, @CK17 were able to show that indeed there are two rather distinct types of rule or concept learners regarding the Type II or XOR problem. In an experiment adapted from the classical six problems setup, participants learned to classify a reduced set of stimuli with two atrribute dimensions (size and shade) into a XOR structure, but were left with some of those stimuli untrained (see figure \@ref(fig:ch2-stimuli) in the methods section). In a subsequent transfer phase of the experiment (including the full set of stimuli) the researchers found 30% of their participants to categorize the novel stimuli in a way that resolves to a full XOR solution of the task while the majority classifies the novel stimuli to the more proximal categories previously learned in the training phase. While these findings provide meaningful insight into category learning behaviour, they don't explain what actually is going on.

One recent attempt at shedding light on the issue is the Category Abstraction Learning model (CAL) put forth by @Schlegelmilch2021. As stated by them directly, CALs three central assumptions are:

> 1. Category rules emerge from two processes of stimulus generalization (similarity) and its direct inverse (category contrast) on independent dimensions. 
> 2. Two attention mechanisms guide learning by focusing on rules, or on the contexts in which they produce errors. 
> 3. Knowing about these contexts inhibits executing the rule, without correcting it, and consequently leads to applying partial rules in different situations. [@Schlegelmilch2021]

One important and novel process introduced with CAL is called contextual modulation: A cognitive mechanism by which conditional hypotheses are based on (previously learned) simple rules that can be applied depending on contextual stimuli (e.g. another stimulus feature), leading to better or easier classification given a more complex rule. 

Regarding the incomplete-XOR problem in particular, that means instead of memorizing every stimulus and then inferring category membership of novel stimuli by similarity, the problem can be seen as a one-dimensional rule that has to be inverted given a specific context; e.g. "small squares belong to A, except when black" [see @Schlegelmilch2021]. Consequently, @Schlegelmilch2021 suggest that extrapolation to a full-XOR solution in an incomplete-XOR task can be explained with CAL by contextual modulation as a result of conditional hypotheses on simple rules.

As mentioned in the beginning and in consequence to the theoretical considerations laid out above results the question of what the nature of a process regarding the categorization of yet unencountered class represetations might look like.

@Kurtz2013 have shown for the classic Type II problem that instructions mentioning rules facilitate learning of an exclusive-or rule structure. This study puts forth that such an effect, according to CAL, should also facilitate extrapolation in an incomplete-xor task. In more detail, rule instructions (compared to neutral instructions) increase the precision/strength with which rules are learned, thereby making a contextual modulation more noticeable or salient, which in turn predicts quicker XOR learning and more frequent XOR extrapolation in the incomplete XOR transfer task. An analogue effect should be induced if, during learning, a simple rule is established before stimuli are introduced that require rule modulation for correct classification (blocked rule), compared to mixing these stimuli throughout (mixed rule). 

This study aims to replicate the findings of @CK17 as well as provide further insights into the following questions:

- Does learning a simple rule on selected stimuli before encountering stimuli introducing a XOR rule increase XOR-extrapolation for novel stimuli during transfer, compared to mixed training of XOR stimuli (blocked vs. mixed training)?
- Do rule instructions, compared to neutral instructions, induce XOR-extrapolation for novel stimuli during transfer (rule vs. neutral instructions)?
- Do rule instructions, compared to neutral instructions, increase the learning speed in the training phase of the incomplete XOR task (during mixed training of XOR)?


## Hypotheses

These research questions lead to the following set of hypotheses. The first regard XOR extrapolations during a transfer task whereas the second is about the learning speed/success during training.

**Hypotheses 1**  
**H1.1** (directed) -- Higher number of extrapolations in the transfer phase for the stimuli of the untrained/incomplete category in the blocked training condition, compared to the mixed training condition  
**H1.2** (directed) -- Higher number of extrapolations for the stimuli of the untrained/incomplete category in the rule instructions condition compared to the neutral instructions condition in the transfer phase  
**H1.3** (undirected, _exploratory_) -- Interaction of rule order and the rule instructions on the number of extrapolations within the untrained/incomplete category

**Hypothesis 2** (directed) -- Quicker learning of categories with rule instructions than without in the mixed rule condition
