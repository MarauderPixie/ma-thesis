# Discussion

As predicted by hypothesis 1.1, we found strong evidence for a main effect of a blocked rule on the number of extrapolations. This in turn fortifies the assumption that this effect can be explained by contextual modulation as proposed by CAL. However, while descriptively it seems like rule language does indeed facilitate XOR extrapolation as predicted by Hypothesis 1.2 - with 7.5% more extrapolated stimuli on average and 10% more persons classified as having learned a full XOR solution (see table \@ref(tab:h1-tbl-summary)) - such an effect can not be confirmed by the conducted analyses. Furthermore, an effect of rule instructions on the learning of (XOR) rules predicted by hypothesis 2.1 could also not be found. 


During planning the experiment and actual data collection
Only after data collection a flaw was discovered in the randomization of stimulus presentation: the unencountered stimuli during training were always the same (always "big and black") for all participants across all conditions. While it is unclear whether this has any influence on the results it might nonetheless introduce some bias in the participants behavior. 





<!-- For this experiment, participants were asked: "Wie hoch schätzt du die Wahrscheinichkeit ein, dass das gezeigte Beispiel entweder zu Nobz oder zu Grot gehört?" (_"How high do you estimate the probability of the shown example belonging to either Nobz or Grot?"_). Note the difference between "how high do you estimate" and the more neutral "what do you estimate": although this is common german phrasing, it might nonetheless introduce some unconscious response bias. Additionally, people have a very intuitive, but ultimately somewhat distorted (or even simply wrong) understanding of probability (literally everything Gigerenzer did since 1990 or so). For further investigations into the matther it is therefore advised to rephrase the question to: "How certain are you of the given example to belong to either Nobz or Grot?"^[which is indeed closer to what people actually have in mind when people are prompted to deal with probability] Thereby avoiding any potential bias and different perceptions/understandings of the concept of probability. -->
