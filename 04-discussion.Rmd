# Discussion

As predicted by hypothesis 1.1, we found moderate evidence for a main effect of a blocked rule on the number of extrapolations. This in turn fortifies the assumption that this effect can be explained by contextual modulation as proposed by CAL. However, while descriptively it seems like rule language does indeed facilitate XOR extrapolation as predicted by Hypothesis 1.2 - with 7.5% more extrapolated stimuli on average and 10% more persons classified as having learned a full XOR solution (see table \@ref(tab:h1-tbl-summary)) - such an effect can not be confirmed by the conducted analyses. Furthermore, an effect of rule instructions on the learning of (XOR) rules predicted by hypothesis 2.1 can also not be confirmed. <!-- An explanation might but lie in CAL nonetheless, namely in it's configural similarity/contrast parameter and how the training phase afects it(?): -->

The most pressing issue in these results is the astonishingly low number of xor-extrapolators over the whole dataset - 24 of 192 people (12.5\%) - in comparison to the previous results by @CK17, who found 9 of 30 (30\%) and 14 of 31 (45\%). While the sample of this study is certainly not overwhelmingly large, it's still a lot bigger than those of @CK17. As to why so few people came to a full XOR solution in our case remains ultimately unclear, we put forth some speculative attempts at an explanation. First of all, XOR-extrapolating novel stimuli might just be a matter of random chance. This is most unlikely, though, since that would not only contradict the findings of @CK17 but also those of @Kurtz2013, who did a whole array of experiments with rather large sample sizes and consistent results; that account also counters the findings of this study, which also shows very distinct and decisive response patterns between proximators and extrapolators, not only in categorical decisions but also in probability judgements (see figures \@ref(fig:h1-extrapolations) and \@ref(fig:xplore-prob) respectively). Another reason may, at least in part, be attributed to a methodical flaw in the execution of the experiment that was discovered only after data collection regarding the randomization of stimulus presentation: the unencountered stimuli during training were always the same for all participants across all conditions (always "big and black"). Are more methodically sound and proper operation had been to randomly assign one of the adjacents quadrants or even the whole set (think: keep the structure as in fig, \@ref(fig:ch2-stimuli) (B) but rotate the set depicted in (A)). It remains unclear whether such a procudre (or the lack thereof) has any ifluence on the results but it's not unreasonable to assume that some bias has been introduced to the participants behaviour. Similar and follow-up studies using a similar setup are advised to implement such a randomization.




<!-- For this experiment, participants were asked: "Wie hoch schätzt du die Wahrscheinichkeit ein, dass das gezeigte Beispiel entweder zu Nobz oder zu Grot gehört?" (_"How high do you estimate the probability of the shown example belonging to either Nobz or Grot?"_). Note the difference between "how high do you estimate" and the more neutral "what do you estimate": although this is common german phrasing, it might nonetheless introduce some unconscious response bias. Additionally, people have a very intuitive, but ultimately somewhat distorted (or even simply wrong) understanding of probability (literally everything Gigerenzer did since 1990 or so). For further investigations into the matther it is therefore advised to rephrase the question to: "How certain are you of the given example to belong to either Nobz or Grot?"^[which is indeed closer to what people actually have in mind when people are prompted to deal with probability] Thereby avoiding any potential bias and different perceptions/understandings of the concept of probability. -->

sth sth attention & german grammar: zum einen sind **Nobz** und **Grot** bei der ersten nennung bold ("rule(s)" nie) und zum anderen lautet der satz am ende: "Gib dein Bestes, um die Regeln für Kategorien Nobz und Grot zu meistern!" - soll heißen, im deutschen steht das Verb am ende und das nomen am anfang, auf englisch andersherum, was wiederum die aufmerksamkeit und/oder emphasis auf "Regeln" oder "meistern" lenken/legen könnte (siehe: "Do your best to master the rules for categories N & G.")
