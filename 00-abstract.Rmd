# Conclusion
\chaptermark{Summary} <!-- Bug in template would put wrong chaptermark here, needs proper fix -->

A growing challenge for understanding the processes and modeling of rule and category learning human concept and category learning is the question of how decision rules are extrapolated for unobserved stimuli and categories. @Schlegelmilch2021 propose that it can be explained by contextual modulation, a cognitive process they put forth as part of their Category Abstraction Learning (CAL) model. This study uses an adapted incomplete-XOR task based on the work of @CK17 to investigate the effect of rule instructions and rule structuring on the extrapolation of unencountered stimuli. We found moderate evidence for an increase in XOR solutions under rule structuring (_BF_ = `r h1_bfs[1,2]`) and no evidence for or against an effect of using instructions mentioning rules (_BF_ = `r h1_bfs[2,2]`), as well as a base amount of extrapolators that is overwhelmingly smaller than previously reported. Additionally, we looked at a possible learning advantage of rule-instructions but found no meaningful evidence for such an effect either (_BF_ = `r bf_h2`). To quote a rather well known poet on the issue: _"Something's awry in the state of [affairs]."_
