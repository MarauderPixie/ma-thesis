One growing challenge in modeling human concept and category learning is the question of how decision rules are extrapolated for unobserved categories. @Schlegelmilch2021 propose that it can be explained by contextual modulation. This study uses an adapted incomplete-XOR task based on @CK17 to investigate the effect of rule instructions and rule structuring on the extrapolation of unencountered stimuli. We found strong evidence for an increase in XOR solutions under rule structuring (_BF_ = `r h1_bfs[1,2]`) and no evidence for or against an increase when using instructions mentioning rules (_BF_ = `r h1_bfs[2,2]`), as well as a base amount of extrapolators which was found to be overwhelmingly smaller than previously reported (see @CK17). Additionally we looked at a possible learning advantage of rule-instructions but found no evidence either (_BF_ = .677).
