One growing challenge in modeling human concept and category learning is the question of how decision rules are extrapolated for unobserved categories. @Schlegelmilch2021 propose that it can be explained by contextual modulation. This study uses an adapted incomplete-XOR task based on @CK17 to investigate the effect of rule instructions and rule structuring on the extrapolation of unencountered stimuli. We found  overwhelming evidence for an increase in XOR solutions under rule structuring (+14%) and substantial evidence for an increase when using rule instructions (+7%). However, the base amount of extrapolators was found to be overwhelmingly smaller than previously reported by @CK17, which poses a major limitation in analysing the results.
