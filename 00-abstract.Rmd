\chaptermark{Summary} <!-- Bug in template would put wrong chaptermark here, needs proper fix -->

Category and rules learning is a major aspect of everyday human life, yet the specifics of how these are acquired or the processes of their workings are not fully understood. This thesis gives an overview of the research on the topic over the last 60 years and presents the Category Abstraction Learning (CAL) framework as a novel approach in explaining recently discovered inconsistencies in existing theories. An experiment was conducted to test those assumptions, namely the effect of task instructions explicitly mentioning a rule and the effect of learning a simple rule before encountering a more complex one. Participants had to learn an incomplete exclusive-or category structure during a supervised learning phase and had to classify the previously untrained stimuli in a subsequent unsupervised transfer phase. The outcome of interest was the number of XOR-extrapolated stimuli of the transfer phase. While an effect of rule instructions can not be confirmed, the results show that the ordering of rules does indeed lead to an increase in extrapolations. Further research in this area is therefore advised to take a closer look at how rule instructions influence the learning and application of category structures.
